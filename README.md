## About

This is a revamp of the product showcase website for Revolut, an all-in-one finance app. Revolut has many features, such as multi-currency accounts, interest on savings, RevPoints for rebates and discounts, customisable cards, sending money among others.

## Design Rationale

Currently, the Revolut website is a Single-Page Application, where the user scrolls through features that take up one page each. Although this UI looks great, the user may not be enticed by the first or second feature and may exit the website instead of discovering other features that excites them but are at the bottom of the page.

In this revamp, the features are presented as more compact cards that allows the user to see all features at a glance. Following that, the user can click on cards for the features that they are interested in, and an overlay will appear with more details about the feature. Some overlays also include interactive components (e.g. currency converter, interest calculator, RevPoints usages) to help users understand these features better.
